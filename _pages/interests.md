I enjoy spending time outdoors and reading. I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina in Boone, NC, which started my love of nature. I have run three marathons. My favorite outdoors activities involve running, cycling, hiking, and backpacking/trekking. I also love traveling and have been to 49 US States and 16 other countries, including China where I spent a year through a Department of State language scholarship.
