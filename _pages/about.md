I started a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship September of 2022 working with Dr. Cesar Terrer at MIT after finish a PhD in Earth and Environment from Boston University. This website is currently still being built. 

Research Interests
======
I am an ecosystem ecologist with a current and previous focus on various aspects and effects of leaf phenology. Below are some of my general future, current, and previous projects. 


Leaf Phenology and Mycorrhizae
------
As the global climate changes, it is becoming more important to understand the uncertain role that the terrestrial biosphere has on carbon storage. Since warmer temperatures affect the timing of phenology transitions in plants, plant phenology is a primary ecological indicator of climate change. Furthermore, how sensitive phenology transitions are to different drivers (e.g., temperature, photoperiod, water availability, leaf age limitations) is highly variable and depends on species and latitude. Without understanding how sensitive phenology is to drivers, we cannot make accurate predictions of phenology and, thus, annual primary productivity. 
Over 80% of plant species associate with soil fungi called mycorrhizae, which increase access to limiting resources such as nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, N) and water. Soil microbes (e.g., mycorrhizae fungi) significantly impact plant phenology events (e.g., flowering) in over 88% of published studies, but their effect on leaf phenology is rarely studied (Oâ€™Brien et al., 2021, Am. J. Bot). In this project, I will investigate if mycorrhizae association of plants affects the sensitivity of leaf phenology in plants to environmental drivers and the resultant carbon fluxes. 



Modeling Senescence
------
For my PhD work, I developed some mechanistic models for predicting leaf and canopy greenness during the summer and autumn.  

Remote-Sensing of Phenology
------
The new generation of geostationary satellites can be used to monitor landscape phenology. During my PhD I developed a statistical model for estimating daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and showed that it could monitor phenological changes in deciduous broadleaf forests. 


Leaf Phenology and Ecohydrology
------
Leaf litter leachate changes based off of the phenological stage of the leaves.
