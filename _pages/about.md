I am currently a PhD Candidate at Boston University in Earth and Environment, expected finish August 2022. I work with Dr. Michael Dietze on monitoring, modeling, and forecasting vegetation foliar phenology. Starting September 2022, I will be a postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology funded through a NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship and will be working with Dr. Cesar Terrer. This website is currently still being built. 

Research Interests
======
I am an ecosystem ecologist with a current and previous focus on various aspects and effects of leaf phenology. Below are some of my general future, current, and previous projects. 


Leaf Phenology and Mycorrhizae
------
For my postdoc I will be investigating relationships between plant mycorrhizal association and leaf phenology. 


Modeling Senescence
------
For my PhD work, I developed some mechanistic models for predicting leaf and canopy greenness during the summer and autumn.  

Remote-Sensing of Phenology
------
The new generation of geostationary satellites can be used to monitor landscape phenology. 


Leaf Phenology and Ecohydrology
------
Leaf litter leachate changes based off of the phenological stage of the leaves.
